"""Memory-vault hook entries for settings.json: pure add/remove on a dict.

No file I/O here. The CLI installer (``jacked/cli.py``) and the dashboard
Features route (``jacked/api/routes/features.py``, wired in M7) both call these
so the entry math lives in exactly one place and can't drift.

Identification anchors on the module-name substring in the entry command
(``memory_capture`` / ``memory_recall``), mirroring how the chain-of-command
installer anchors on ``chain_of_command_context`` (cli.py:1774-1777). That keeps
us from ever touching a foreign hook, or the sibling jacked hooks that also live
under ``SessionStart``/``SessionEnd`` (the session tracker, chain-of-command).

Capture entries are async (``"async": True``): Claude Code is not blocked while
the SessionEnd/PreCompact triage runs. The recall entry is SYNCHRONOUS (no
``async`` key) because an async SessionStart hook's stdout is NOT injected into
the session context, and injecting the brief is the entire point (cli.py:1791).
