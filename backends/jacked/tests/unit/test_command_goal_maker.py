"""Content-presence regression tests for the /goal-maker command — forges a
hardcore, overnight-sized /goal brief from the current working context, with a
default-PR / opt-in-merge toggle.

These guard the contract: default is PR-only (merge is opt-in via the `merge`
arg), auto-merge is always CI-gated and uses a true merge commit, the brief
is a verbose FILE (no size cap) handed to /goal as a short measured pointer +
stuck-detection backstop (drives to completion, never caps successful work) +
DATA-only rule, and the UI/UX/TDD quality bars are baked in.
Like the other command tests, these are string-presence checks on the LLM
instruction document, not runtime-behavior assertions.
