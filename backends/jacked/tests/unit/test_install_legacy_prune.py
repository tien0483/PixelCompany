"""`jacked install` must prune hooks from features retired in 0.70.0.

The security gatekeeper (PreToolUse/PermissionRequest) and the session-
indexing Stop hook are gone; a stale settings.json entry would fire a
retired command on every tool call / session stop. The prune must operate
on the shared in-memory dict so later hook installers (session tracker,
QA suggest) can't write a stale copy back — that exact clobber shipped
once in a pre-release build of 0.70.0.
