"""Content-presence regression tests for the strategic, decisive /whats-next
engine: coverage-matrix-led assessment (Step 5), commit-to-one-initiative
decision (Step 6), and the /goal-brief forge (Step 8).

These are intentionally string-presence checks: the file is an LLM
instruction document, not code. The tests guard the critical contract
against accidental deletion — they do NOT assert Claude's runtime
behavior, which is only enforceable by the model at runtime.

Where it matters, assertions anchor on strings that appear ONLY inside
the clause they guard (verified by mutation testing), so deleting that
clause actually turns a test red rather than passing on a duplicate
word elsewhere.
