"""SessionStart hook: auto-load the chain-of-command dispatch policy.

Reads ~/.claude/skills/chain-of-command/SKILL.md, strips its YAML frontmatter,
and prints a short framing preamble followed by the skill body to stdout. A
SYNCHRONOUS SessionStart hook's stdout is injected into the session context, so
this makes the dispatch policy active from the very first turn of every new
Claude Code session.

Absence of the skill file means the user disabled the feature via the
dashboard's skill toggle: exit 0 printing NOTHING. Every failure path (missing
file, permission error, bad encoding) is silent for the same reason: this hook
must NEVER break a session start.
