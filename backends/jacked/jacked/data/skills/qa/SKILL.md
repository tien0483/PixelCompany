name: qa
description: Use when testing UI changes for visual correctness, interactions, console errors, and edge cases. Performs browser-based QA and returns a detailed issue list for planning fixes.
---

First, check if a repo-scoped version exists in the current project:
1. If `.claude/skills/qa/SKILL.md` exists (Glob) → read and follow it instead of this file.
2. If `.claude/commands/qa.md` exists (Glob) → read and follow it instead.
3. Otherwise, proceed with the global decision guide below.

---

Two commands are available — read the appropriate one and follow it:

- `~/.claude/commands/qa.md` — Quick, focused QA pass (single agent). Visual, interactive, console, and edge case checks on specific changes. Best for targeted fixes or single-feature verification.
- `~/.claude/commands/ux.md` — Thorough parallel UX review (multiple agents). Tests 6 UX aspects across multiple pages simultaneously. Best when changes touch layout, navigation, or multiple components.

Both are **read-only detection tools** — they return a detailed issue list but do NOT fix code (the one exception is an explicit opt-in follow-on `/qa` can offer at the end: turning a verified journey into a regression test, only with your approval). After receiving findings, use `superpowers:writing-plans` to build a fix plan from the issues. **Write the plan as HTML, not Markdown** (jacked's preferred format for human-consumption artifacts — see `~/.claude/jacked-reference.md` § Artifact Format Preference). Copy `~/.claude/jacked-templates/plan-template.html` and save to `docs/superpowers/plans/{YYYY-MM-DD}-qa-fixes.html`. Tell the sub-skill explicitly: "Output as HTML using the jacked template — not Markdown." Let the user iterate, then execute with `/dcr` verification.

Decision guide:
- Changed button styling or a single component? → `/qa`
- Changed layout, interactions, AND multiple pages? → `/ux`
- Want faster repeat QA runs? → `/jacked-setup qa` to pre-configure browser tool and framework checks
