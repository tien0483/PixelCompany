# Appended (verbatim, reviewed production copy) to the rules body when it lands
# in Codex's AGENTS.md. The behaviors + shipped skills speak Claude Code
# vocabulary; this section maps that vocabulary to Codex's native equivalents at
# runtime. It deliberately keeps one "CLAUDE.md" (the final mapping bullet), so
# the CLAUDE.md->AGENTS.md rename in `_codex_rules_body` runs on the SOURCE body
# only, before this adapter is appended.
_CODEX_ADAPTER = """\
## Codex runtime adapter (managed by `jacked install`)

The behaviors above and the jacked skills in ~/.agents/skills were authored for Claude Code. Running under Codex, map Claude vocabulary to your native equivalents:

- Slash commands are skills here: a reference to `/dcr`, `/qa`, `/pr`, etc. means the same-name skill in ~/.agents/skills - invoke it as `$dcr`, `$qa`, ... (or via `/skills`).
- "Task tool" / "Agent tool" / `subagent_type: "..."` means your subagent mechanism: spawn parallel subagents natively. Custom agent definitions live in ~/.codex/agents/*.toml. Where a named Claude agent (e.g. double-check-reviewer) is unavailable, inline its described role into the subagent prompt.
- Claude model dispatch (`model: "opus"`, `"fable"`, `"sonnet"`, `"haiku"`) does not apply: ignore Anthropic model names and pick your own model/reasoning effort per task - cheap and fast for mechanical sweeps, strongest for judgment and review.
- Browser tooling: `mcp__plugin_playwright_playwright__*` tools and Claude-in-Chrome do not exist here. Use the MCP servers from your own config (~/.codex/config.toml); `mcp__chrome-devtools__*` names resolve once a `chrome-devtools` MCP server is registered. Where instructions say `claude mcp add ...`, use `codex mcp add ...`.
- File references to ~/.claude/commands/<name>.md: the same content ships at ~/.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md.
- "Plan mode" exists here too (the `plan` permission mode) - use it where the behaviors call for it.
- Where a rule or skill says CLAUDE.md, your instruction file is AGENTS.md (~/.codex/AGENTS.md globally, the repo's AGENTS.md per project).
