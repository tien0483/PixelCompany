"""Codex usage via the ``codex app-server`` JSON-RPC interface.

Codex (ChatGPT-plan-backed) exposes up to two rate-limit windows. The
officially documented, machine-readable source is ``codex app-server``
(newline-delimited JSON-RPC over stdin/stdout): after ``initialize`` +
``initialized`` we call ``account/rateLimits/read`` and get
``result.rateLimits.primary`` / ``.secondary``, each with ``usedPercent``,
``windowDurationMins`` and ``resetsAt`` (unix epoch). Historically primary was
the 5h window and secondary the weekly one, but the shape is NOT positional
anymore: weekly-only accounts report a lone primary with
``windowDurationMins=10080`` and ``secondary: null``. So we classify each
window by its duration (positional only as a fallback) and normalize to
jacked's ``five_hour``/``seven_day`` shape, writing the same cache columns the
Anthropic path uses, so every downstream consumer (menubar, panel, auto-swap)
is unchanged. A window an AUTHORITATIVE payload no longer reports gets its
cache column CLEARED — otherwise a dead window's last reading survives forever
(a weekly-only account kept showing a stale 100% "7d" from a window that
expired days earlier). A partial or unrecognized payload never clears: it
preserves the last known value and logs a WARNING instead.

This is NOT the ToS-risky chatgpt.com backend scrape and NOT the rollout-jsonl
file (null since gpt-5.4) — it's the supported RPC.
