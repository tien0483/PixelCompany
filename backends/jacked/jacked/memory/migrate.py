"""Migrate the third-party ``remember`` plugin's ``.remember/`` history into the
jacked memory vault, and retire the plugin -- the data-integrity milestone.

The one binding rule here is that the source ``.remember/`` dirs are treated as
READ-ONLY, forever. Migration only ever *reads* them (no write, chmod, rename or
delete touches a source), copies their history into
``groups/<group>/episodic/<repo-short>/``, and VERIFIES the imported entry counts
against the source before anything lands in the vault. Any per-file mismatch
fails that repo loud: its staging is discarded, nothing for it lands in the
vault, and the overall run reports a nonzero failure.

The flow per discovered ``(repo, .remember)`` (see the design doc, section 4):

1. SOURCE COUNT  -- count episodic entries per file with the plugin's own header
   regexes (``consolidate.py:32`` + the 12h form from ``save-session.sh:192``).
   A file with content but no matching header counts as one opaque blob (it still
   migrates verbatim).
2. BUILD (staging) -- copy today/recent/archive/core-memories/identity through
   VERBATIM (malformed history included -- migration never "fixes" it) into a
   temp dir; fold a non-empty ``now.md`` into the current day's today file under a
   ``## migrated-now`` section; turn each ``core-memories.md`` entry into a
   candidate decision note. Never overwrite existing vault content -- a name
   collision gets a ``.migrated-<n>`` suffix.
3. VERIFY -- re-count the staged files with the same regexes; staged must equal
   source per file (the now.md fold-in and the candidate notes are ADDITIONS
   tracked separately in the report, not replacements). Any mismatch fails the
   repo.
4. COMMIT -- only after verify passes, move staging into the vault and register
   the repo/group. One vault commit at the end covers every successful repo.

Plugin retirement disables ``remember@claude-plugins-official`` in
``<home>/.claude/settings.json`` using the same explicit ``enabledPlugins[id] =
False`` contract as ``features.toggle_claude_plugin`` -- never ``.pop`` (an absent
key reads as "enabled by default"). Sources are never removed by retirement.
