"""Skill-pack routes — enable/disable jacked-curated upstream skill bundles.

A pack is a named bundle of skills living in a third-party GitHub repo,
installed live through the ``npx skills`` CLI (see ``jacked.packs``). These
routes are the dashboard surface: list the registry with per-pack install
status, and toggle a pack on/off. All the orchestration, filesystem
verification and npx handling lives in ``jacked.packs``; this module only
adapts it to HTTP.

Enable/disable run the (slow, 10-60s) npx subprocess off the event loop via
``asyncio.to_thread`` so a running install never blocks other requests.

Protection: state-changing requests are guarded by the process-wide
``HostValidationMiddleware`` (jacked/api/security.py), same as every other
PUT in the dashboard — Host-header validation blocks DNS rebinding and a
foreign ``Origin`` on an unsafe method is rejected as CSRF. There is no
per-route auth layer to add; matching the features PUT means adding nothing
extra here.
