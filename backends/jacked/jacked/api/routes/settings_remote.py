"""API routes for the remote-access (network bind) setting.

Flipping remote access changes WHERE the unauthenticated dashboard listens, so
it is a security decision. It persists to the settings DB, the single source of
truth that ``resolve_bind`` reads at every boot/restart. Saving (PUT) and
applying (POST restart) are deliberately separate, mirroring the upgrade
endpoint: the DB write is cheap and reversible, the restart is the disruptive
part the client stages behind its own confirm + overlay.
