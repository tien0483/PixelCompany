"""Menu-bar summary route.

A single, lightweight endpoint the macOS status-item timer polls to set the
live pill. The pill tracks the **active** account (the one selected in Claude
Code) — that's the usage the user is actually working against — so we resolve
the active account via the same 3-layer logic as ``/api/auth/active-credential``
and summarize it. ``worst`` (worst across all accounts) is included too for a
fleet-wide glance. Pure summary helpers live in
``jacked.service.menubar_summary`` (no rumps/pyobjc here).
