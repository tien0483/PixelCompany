"""Bind resolution and pre-bound socket construction for the dashboard server.

The dashboard has no authentication layer, so *where it listens* is a security
decision, not a convenience knob. This module is the single place that decides
which addresses the server binds, using one fixed precedence:

1. **Explicit CLI ``--host``** — a one-shot override. When the operator typed a
   host, we honor exactly that and nothing else: no settings read, no Tailscale
   detection. This preserves today's CLI behavior verbatim, including
   ``--host 0.0.0.0``. It is never persisted.
2. **DB settings** — ``remote_access_enabled`` (the bare string ``'true'`` /
   ``'false'``, matching the settings_swap.py convention) and
   ``remote_access_scope`` (``'tailscale'`` | ``'all'``). This is the GUI's
   channel and the durable source of truth across reboots and upgrades.
3. **Loopback default** — ``127.0.0.1`` when nothing above applies.

Fail-safe rules (a bind decision must never take the dashboard down):

- The socket sets are **mutually exclusive** so two sockets never race for the
  same ``addr:port`` (EADDRINUSE): loopback → ``(127.0.0.1,)``; tailscale →
  ``(127.0.0.1, 100.x)``; all → ``(0.0.0.0,)`` *alone*.
- ``remote_access_scope`` other than the two documented values (missing, typo,
  garbage) falls back to the documented default ``'tailscale'`` and logs a
  warning naming the offending value.
- When Tailscale is requested but **no tailnet IP is detected**, we bind
  loopback only, record a human-readable ``fallback_reason``, and log loudly.
  We never silently widen to ``0.0.0.0`` on a detection miss, and detection
  failures never raise out of :func:`resolve_bind`.
- A DB read error (corrupt/locked settings DB) is caught and degraded to the
  loopback default with a warning — a broken DB must not stop the server from
  coming up on loopback.
