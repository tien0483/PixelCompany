description: Use to produce a polished, narrated product demo / walkthrough / how-to video for documentation and education (embed in docs, README, release notes, onboarding). NOT bug evidence — that's /qa-video. Pass the feature/flow to demo, or let it auto-detect.

> **Tip:** MCP-based browser tools (Chrome DevTools MCP, Playwright MCP) require no bash approval and work instantly. For voiceover + muxing you'll want `ffmpeg`; macOS `say` provides offline narration with zero external accounts.

You are producing a **clean, narrated walkthrough video that teaches a feature** for end-user
documentation — not bug evidence (that's `/qa-video`). The output is something you'd embed in
docs, a README, a release note, or onboarding: staged data, deliberate pacing, captions and/or
voiceover, and a **narration script committed to the repo** so the whole thing regenerates when
the UI changes.

## Step 0: Scope the demo

- **What to demo:** if `$ARGUMENTS` names a feature/flow ("the new export wizard", "login →
  first dashboard"), use it. Otherwise infer from what changed (`git diff`/recent commits) or
  ask the user what they want taught.
- **Audience & goal:** a new user learning this capability. One video = one coherent story
  (don't cram the whole app into one clip; suggest separate clips per feature).
- **Where it lands:** ask or default to `docs/videos/` (the MP4 + captions) plus the narration
  script alongside it. Note the embed target (README, docs site, release note).

## Step 1: Write the narration script — the SOURCE OF TRUTH

Everything is driven by a narration script you write FIRST and commit. It's an ordered list of
**segments**, each with an `id`, the `text` to be spoken/captioned, and a `type`:
- `narrate` — talk over the current screen (no interaction; e.g. an intro or a "notice that…").
- `action` — the browser actually does something (click, type, navigate) while narrating.
- `highlight` — call attention to a specific element (zoom/outline) while narrating.

Save it as `docs/videos/<slug>.narration.json` (committed — diff it like code, regenerate on
release):
```json
[
  { "id": "intro",        "type": "narrate",   "text": "Welcome. This shows how to export a report in three steps." },
  { "id": "open-reports", "type": "action",    "text": "From the dashboard, open the Reports tab.", "do": "click Reports nav" },
  { "id": "pick-range",   "type": "highlight", "text": "Pick a date range — the last 30 days is the default.", "focus": "the date-range picker" },
  { "id": "export",       "type": "action",    "text": "Click Export, choose CSV, and your download starts.", "do": "click Export, choose CSV" },
  { "id": "outro",        "type": "narrate",   "text": "That's it — exports run in the background and email you when ready." }
]
```
Keep each segment to one idea and ~1–2 sentences. Order them as the real flow. This script is
what makes the video reproducible: edit the text or steps, re-run, get a fresh video.

## Step 2: Detect the browser tool + recording path

Detect exactly as `/qa-video` Step 0–1 (read `~/.claude/commands/qa-video.md` if needed):
- **Path P — Playwright MCP native video** (preferred: true motion + chapter markers; needs
  `--caps=devtools`). On Playwright, also start a **trace** (Path T) — it's free alongside.
- **Path F — frame-stitch fallback** for any other tool (Chrome DevTools MCP / agent-browser)
  → assemble frames into MP4 (ffmpeg) or animated GIF (ImageMagick, zero-install).
Announce the chosen path. For a *demo* (vs QA evidence), Playwright native video is strongly
preferred — smoother motion reads better for teaching.

## Step 3: Stage a clean set — this is a demo, not a test

A teaching video must look intentional — and the demo *performs actions* (clicks, exports,
saves), so it must run on an ISOLATED instance, never production:
- **Record against an isolated instance.** Best available, in order: (1) a **PR / preview /
  ephemeral deploy** if one exists (the PR's "View deployment" link, a Vercel/Netlify/Cloudflare
  preview, a Railway/Heroku review app); (2) **spin it up locally** — dev server + a local DB
  with seed/sample data (`docker compose up`, `manage.py runserver`, `npm run dev`/`pnpm dev`,
  `.env.local`), pointed at `localhost`; (3) a disposable staging the user confirms. Keep the
  data **clean and staged** — this is a polished demo, not a stress test.
- **Confirm non-prod before any write — fail closed.** Before the first save/export/submit, you
  are READ-ONLY until you confirm ALL of: (a) the host is local or the EXACT preview URL (never
  the production domain); (b) the running PROCESS is on a local/throwaway DB — read it from the
  live process (`ps eww <pid>`, `/proc/<pid>/environ`) or an app endpoint, NOT a dotfile (a
  preview/remote URL alone does NOT prove the DB); (c) email/payment/webhook integrations are
  sandboxed or disabled (a local DB won't stop a real send/charge); (d) **you started it** — the
  server is one YOU spun up this session or the verified preview env, not one you merely found
  listening. If you can't prove ALL of it, do NOT perform writes — narrate a read-only walkthrough
  instead. When unsure, it's production. A URL passed in or auto-detected clears only the Host
  check, never the rest.
  **This gate governs EVERY write in the skill** — logging in as the demo persona (next bullet),
  every `action`/`highlight` segment that submits/saves/exports (Step 4), and any re-run. On an
  unproven/production target: navigate + observe only — no login, no writes.
- Log in as the **demo persona** with **representative, clean data** (not empty, not debug
  junk, no real PII — use seed/sample data; if the screen would show real customer data, switch
  to a demo account or sanitize).
- Set a **clean, doc-friendly viewport** — 1280×720 or 1920×1080 (16:9 embeds well).
- **Remove noise:** dismiss cookie banners, close debug overlays/devtools panels, hide any
  "localhost"/staging banners, silence notifications.
- Pre-navigate to the true starting point so segment 1 opens on the intended screen.

## Step 4: Record, timed to the narration

Start recording BEFORE the first navigation (trace/video only capture what happens after start).
Then walk the segments **deliberately** — a teaching pace, slower than a QA run:
1. Start the video (and trace on Playwright). Path F: capture frames per sub-step into
   `docs/videos/<slug>/frame_####.png`.
2. For each segment, in order:
   - `narrate` → hold on the current screen for the segment's beat (≥ the spoken duration; see
     Step 5). No interaction.
   - `action` → perform the interaction with visible, unhurried motion; insert a ~0.8–1.5s
     settle after each click/type so the viewer can follow. Use `browser_snapshot` to locate
     elements by role/label.
   - `highlight` → draw attention to the focus element: scroll it into view and, if supported,
     zoom or outline it (Playwright: `evaluate` a temporary outline/box-shadow on the element,
     or use a known highlight API; otherwise center + a brief pause). Remove the outline after.
3. Stop the video (and trace). Record the saved paths.

## Step 5: Voiceover (optional but recommended) + caption timing

The trick that syncs everything: generate per-segment audio, MEASURE each clip's duration, and
time the browser holds to those durations.

- **Offline default — macOS `say`:** per segment, `say -v Samantha -o seg-<id>.aiff "<text>"`,
  then read its duration (`ffprobe -i seg-<id>.aiff -show_entries format=duration -of csv=p=0`)
  into a `durations.json`. Drive each segment's on-screen hold for at least that long.
- **Higher quality (only if the user has it):** an external TTS (e.g. ElevenLabs) — same
  segment→audio→duration flow. Don't assume an API key; ask, and fall back to `say`.
- **Captions:** when voiceover WAS generated, derive caption timings from `durations.json`
  (the measured per-segment lengths) so the text tracks the audio exactly. Only on the
  no-voiceover path use a fixed reading-speed estimate (~15 chars/sec). Either way, write a
  `.vtt`/`.srt` from the segment text and ship the sidecar or burn it in (Step 6 `subtitles=`).

## Step 6: Assemble the final video

- **Path F frames → video:** `ffmpeg -y -framerate <fps> -pattern_type glob -i 'frame_*.png' -vf "scale=trunc(iw/2)*2:trunc(ih/2)*2,format=yuv420p" -c:v libx264 -movflags +faststart out.mp4` (or ImageMagick GIF if no ffmpeg).
- **Build one narration track** from the per-segment clips (in `narration.json` order) with a
  short silence pad between segments, then mux it onto the silent recording:
  ```bash
  # 0.4s silence pad, then a concat list: seg-intro.aiff, gap.aiff, seg-open-reports.aiff, …
  ffmpeg -y -f lavfi -t 0.4 -i anullsrc=r=44100:cl=stereo gap.aiff
  ffmpeg -y -f concat -safe 0 -i list.txt -c:a aac -b:a 192k narration.aac   # list.txt = file 'seg-*.aiff' / file 'gap.aiff' lines
  # mux audio onto the silent video (<silent-video> = the .webm from Path P, or out.mp4 from Path F)
  ffmpeg -y -i <silent-video> -i narration.aac -c:v libx264 -c:a aac -b:a 192k -shortest demo.mp4
  ```
  `-shortest` trims to the shorter track so a slight timing drift never leaves frozen frames or
  trailing silence.
- **Captions:** ship `demo.vtt` next to `demo.mp4` (docs players show it), or burn in with
  `-vf "subtitles=demo.vtt"` if the embed target can't show a sidecar.
- **Polish (optional):** a 1–2s title card intro/outro (ffmpeg or a stitched frame). Keep it
  short — teaching, not advertising.

## Step 7: Deliver into the docs

- Write `demo.mp4` (+ `demo.vtt` + the `.narration.json`) to the chosen docs location.
- Provide the **embed snippet** for the target (Markdown image/link, an HTML `<video controls>`
  with the `.vtt` track, or the docs-site shortcode).
- State that the video is **regenerable**: the narration script is committed, so on a UI change
  you re-run `/demo-video` to produce an updated clip — no manual re-recording.

## Step 8: Verify the artifact is real

Don't report success on a file existing — prove it:
- `ffprobe demo.mp4` → duration > 0, a **video stream AND (if voiceover) an audio stream**,
  sane resolution. (`magick identify` for a GIF: frame count > 1.)
- File size is non-trivial; spot-check that the captions/narration text matches what's on screen
  at that timestamp.

If duration is 0, audio is missing when it should be present, or the codec is junk → it failed;
fix and re-run, don't hand over a broken clip.
