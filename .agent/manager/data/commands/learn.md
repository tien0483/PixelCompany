description: Use after corrections, mistakes, or when the user wants to codify a preference into a permanent CLAUDE.md rule.
---

You are the Learn command - you extract lessons from the current conversation and turn them into durable CLAUDE.md rules that prevent the same mistake twice.

## INPUT HANDLING

**If `$ARGUMENTS` is provided**: Use that as the explicit lesson to encode.
**If no arguments**: Analyze the conversation for corrections, mistakes, user frustrations, or repeated instructions. If you genuinely cannot find a clear lesson, say so honestly. Do NOT invent a lesson just to have output.

## PROCESS

### Step 1: Identify the Lesson

Look for these signals in the conversation:
- User corrected Claude's approach ("no, do it THIS way")
- User repeated an instruction Claude forgot
- Claude made a wrong assumption
- User expressed frustration with a pattern
- A bug was caused by a recurring mistake
- User stated a preference explicitly

Extract the core lesson. Ask: "What's the GENERAL principle here, not just this specific case?"

### Step 2: Read Existing Rules AND Lessons

Check these places for existing coverage:
1. **`lessons.md`** in the project root - the auto-maintained scratchpad of session learnings
2. **Native Claude Code auto-memory** (`MEMORY.md` and its linked memory files, where corrections saved via the `#` shortcut or a "remember ..." message land automatically on current Claude Code) - in the real world this, not lessons.md, is where many recurring corrections actually accumulate
3. **Project-level `CLAUDE.md`** in the project root - permanent project rules
4. **User's global `CLAUDE.md`** (the one managed by Claude Code, typically in the user's Claude config directory) - permanent global rules
5. **Scoped `.claude/rules/*.md`** files (those carrying `paths:` frontmatter) - file-type/path-specific rules

For each, scan for:
- Rules/lessons that already cover this topic (don't duplicate)
- Rules that CONFLICT with the proposed lesson (flag these)
- The current number of rules (if 50+ in CLAUDE.md, note this)

**Graduation path**: A lesson graduates to a permanent rule once it has *proven itself by recurring*. That proof can come from EITHER source, interchangeably:
- It already exists in `lessons.md` (strike counter at `[2x]`+), OR
- It was captured in native auto-memory via `#`/"remember".

Either way, note this in your output: "This lesson is graduating from <lessons.md|auto-memory> to a permanent CLAUDE.md rule." If NEITHER lessons.md nor auto-memory exists (or neither holds this lesson), treat the **conversation itself** as the source — extract the lesson directly from what just happened (and weigh firmness accordingly, see Step 3).

### Step 3: Draft the Rule

Write a concise rule following these principles:
- **1-3 lines maximum** - if it takes a paragraph, it's too vague
- **Lead with ALWAYS or NEVER** when possible - directives, not suggestions
- **Lead with WHY** - the reason makes the rule stick
- **Be concrete** - "ALWAYS use pydantic v2 for model definitions" not "use modern libraries"
- **Be actionable** - Claude should know exactly what to do differently
- **Match firmness to proven confidence** - a lesson that has recurred 2-3x (graduating from lessons.md or auto-memory) has earned a hard `ALWAYS`/`NEVER`. A first-time, single-observation lesson is a *hypothesis*, not a law: write it as a softer note (e.g. "prefer X over Y" / "this repo seems to use pnpm") or leave it in lessons.md/auto-memory to mature — do NOT promote a one-off into an enforced rule. One light inline marker is enough; don't invent a confidence schema.
- **NEVER hardcode machine-specific paths** (e.g. `/Users/jack/...`, `/home/user/...`, `~/.local/share/uv/tools/...`). Use generic references like "the project root", "the Claude config directory", or `~/.claude/` when referring to well-known locations. These files get synced to the repo and must work for any contributor.

Good examples:
```
- ALWAYS use absolute paths when calling Edit tool (relative paths cause bugs on Windows)
- NEVER commit .env files - use .env.example with placeholder values instead
- when creating pydantic models, ALWAYS use pydantic v2 field validators (v1 @validator is deprecated)
```

Bad examples:
```
- try to write better code (too vague)
- remember to be careful with paths (not actionable)
- there was a bug with the thing (not a rule)
- check /Users/jack/.local/share/uv/tools/... (machine-specific path)
```

### Step 4: Write the Rule

Act confidently. Do NOT ask the user for permission — just write the rule.

**Choose the destination with this three-way scope test (apply in order, first match wins):**
1. **Applies only to a specific file type or directory** (API handlers, test files, migrations, `*.tsx` components, etc.) → scoped **`.claude/rules/<topic>.md`** with `paths:` frontmatter. This keeps the always-loaded CLAUDE.md lean — a scoped rule loads only when a matching file is open, instead of bloating every session.
2. **Project-specific mechanics, conventions, or architecture** (this repo's build commands, patterns, stack choices) → **project `./CLAUDE.md`**.
3. **Static personal preference or style** that holds across every project (tone, default tools, workflow habits) → **user's global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`**.

If none clearly applies (a genuine tie), default to the **user's global CLAUDE.md**.

**Scoped-rule frontmatter format** (`.claude/rules/<topic>.md`):
```
---
paths:
  - "src/api/**/*.ts"
  - "**/handlers/**"
---

- ALWAYS validate request bodies against a schema before use (unchecked input caused an injection bug)
```
The `paths:` globs decide which open files trigger the rule. Use one file per topic (`api.md`, `tests.md`, `migrations.md`); append to it if it already exists.

- **APPEND-ONLY**: Add the rule to the end of the chosen file. Never edit or remove existing rules.
- If the destination file doesn't exist, create it — CLAUDE.md with a header comment; a `.claude/rules/*.md` with its `paths:` frontmatter block first.
- If you spotted conflicting rules in Step 2, rewrite the conflicting rule to incorporate both (in-place edit, not duplicate).
- If the file has 50+ rules, suggest running `/audit-rules` to consolidate.
- If the lesson is graduating from `lessons.md` or auto-memory, remove or update the source entry after writing the permanent rule.

### Step 5: Report What You Did

After writing, give a brief summary (1-2 lines) of what was added and where. Don't ask if it's OK — it's done.

### Step 6: Mirror a graduated rule into the memory vault (guarded)

If the memory vault is enabled (`jacked memory status --quiet` exits 0; if it exits nonzero, skip this step silently), ALSO record a rule you just graduated to CLAUDE.md as a durable convention note, so it is searchable across every repo:

```bash
jacked memory add --type convention --title "<the rule, short>" --body "<the rule + why it exists>"
```

Only mirror rules that actually graduated (recurred and earned a permanent CLAUDE.md entry), not first-time hypotheses. The vault note complements CLAUDE.md; it does not replace it. If the vault is off, do nothing here.

## SAFETY RAILS

- NEVER invent lessons from nothing - if the conversation has no clear lesson, say so
- NEVER duplicate an existing rule - update the existing one instead
- NEVER hardcode machine-specific absolute paths in rules or lessons — use generic/portable references
- ALWAYS route by the Step 4 three-way scope test (file-scoped → `.claude/rules/`, project → `./CLAUDE.md`, personal → global); default to global CLAUDE.md only when none clearly applies
- NEVER promote a first-time, single-observation lesson into a hard ALWAYS/NEVER — match firmness to how often it has actually recurred
